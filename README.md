# Full EditorConfi

Complete list of C# editor config settings. 

These are my choice of options but feel free to fork and update as you please.

My goal is to keep this list complete.  If new items come out that I am missing please file an issue and I will update ASAP.

Thanks and enjoy.

Editor Config file with all Dotnet options.
